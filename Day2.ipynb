            "Fatima bint Muhammad (Arabic: فَاطِمَة بِنْت مُحَمَّد, romanized: Fāṭima bint Muḥammad; 605/15–632 CE), commonly known as Fatima al-Zahra' (Arabic: فَاطِمَة ٱلزَّهْرَاء, romanized: Fāṭima al-Zahrāʾ), was the daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his wife Khadija.[1] Fatima's husband was Ali, the fourth of the Rashidun Caliphs and the first Shia Imam. Fatima's sons were Hasan and Husayn, the second and third Shia Imams, respectively.[2][3] Fatima has been compared to Mary, mother of Jesus, especially in Shia Islam.[4][5] Muhammad is said to have regarded her as the best of women[6][7] and the dearest person to him.[8][6] She is often viewed as an ultimate archetype for Muslim women and an example of compassion, generosity, and enduring suffering.[4] It is through Fatima that Muhammad's family line has survived to this date.[9][7] Her name and her epithets remain popular choices for Muslim girls.[10][11]\n",
            "\n",
            "When Muhammad died in 632, Fatima and her husband Ali refused to acknowledge the authority of the first caliph, Abu Bakr. The couple and their supporters held that Ali was the rightful successor of Muhammad,[4] possibly referring to his announcement at the Ghadir Khumm.[12] Controversy surrounds Fatima's death within six months of Muhammad's.[13] Sunni Islam holds that Fatima died from grief.[3] In Shia Islam, however, Fatima's (miscarriage and) death are said to have been the direct result of her injuries during a raid on her house to subdue Ali, ordered by Abu Bakr.[14] It is believed that Fatima's dying wish was that the caliph should not attend her funeral.[15][16] She was buried secretly at night and her exact burial place remains uncertain.[17][18]\n",
            "\n",
            "Her most common epithet is al-Zahra (lit. 'the one that shines, the radiant'),[6] which encodes her piety and regularity in prayer.[19] This epithet is believed by the Shia to be a reference to her primordial creation from light that continues to radiate throughout the creation.[6] The Shia Ibn Babawahy (d. 991) writes that, whenever Fatima prayed, her light shone for the inhabitants of the heavens as starlight shines for the inhabitants of the earth.[20] Other titles of her in Shia are al-Ṣiddiqa (lit. 'the righteous'),[11] al-Tahira (lit. 'the pure'),[21] al-Mubaraka (lit. 'the blessed'),[21] and al-Mansura (lit. 'helped by God').[6] Another Shia title is al-Muḥadditha, in view of the reports that angels spoke to Fatima on multiple occasions,[22][23][24] similar to Mary, mother of Jesus.[25]\n",
            "\n",
            "Fatima is also recognized as Sayyidat Nisa' al-Janna (lit. 'mistress of the women of paradise') and Sayyidat Nisa' al-Alamin (lit. 'mistress of the women of the worlds') in Shia and Sunni collections of hadith, including the canonical Sunni Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.[7]\n",
            "\n",
            "The name Fatima is from the Arabic root f-t-m (lit. 'to wean') and signifies the Shia belief that she, her progeny, and her adherents (shi'a) have been spared from hellfire.[6][26][27] Alternatively, the word Fatima is associated in Shia sources with Fatir (lit. 'creator', a name of God) as the earthly symbol of the divine creative power.[28]\n",
            "\n",
            "A kunya or honorific title of Fatima in Islam is Umm Abiha (lit. 'the mother of her father'), suggesting that Fatima was exceptionally nurturing towards her father.[29][30][31] Umm al-Aima (lit. 'the mother of Imams') is a kunya of Fatima in Twelver sources,[4] as eleven of the Twelve Imams descended from her.[32]\n",
            "\n",
            "Fatima was born in Mecca to Khadija, the first of Muhammad's wives.[1] The mainstream Sunni view is that Khadija gave birth to Fatima in 605 CE, at age fifty, five years before the first Quranic revelations.[2] This implies that Fatima was over eighteen at the time of her marriage, which would have been unusual in Arabia.[2][3] Twelver sources, however, report that Fatima was born in about 612 or 615 CE,[2][33][34] when Khadija would have been slightly older.[35] The report of the Sunni Ibn Sa'd in his Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kubra suggests that Fatima was born when Muhammad was about thirty-five years old.[35]\n",
            "\n",

For Madelung, however, the absence of the Muhajirun (migrants from Mecca) from this meeting suggests that the Ansar gathered to re-establish the control of the Ansar over their city Medina, under the belief that the Muhajirun would mostly return to Mecca after Muhammad's death.[108][109]\n",

            "An example is verse 3:61 of the Quran. After an inconclusive debate about Jesus with a Christian delegation from Najran in 10/631-2, it was decided to engage in mubuhala, where both parties would pray to invoke God's curse upon whoever was the liar. This is when Muhammad is reported to have received verse 3:61 of the Quran, also known as the verse of mubahala,[190][191][192] which reads\n",
            "And to whomsoever disputes with thee over it, after the knowledge that has come unto thee [about Jesus], say, \"Come! Let us call upon our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves. Then let us pray earnestly, so as to place the curse of God upon those who lie.\"[193]\n",
            "Madelung argues that 'our sons' in the verse of mubahala must refer to Muhammad's grandchildren, Hasan and Husayn. In that case, he continues, it would be reasonable to also include in the event their parents, Ali and Fatima.[194] Madelung writes that their inclusion by Muhammad in this significant ritual must have raised the religious rank of his family.[194] A similar view is voiced by Lalani.[195]\n",
            "\n",
            "Of those present on Muhammad's side, Shia traditions are unanimous that 'our women' refers to Fatima and 'ourselves' refers to Ali.[196] In particular, since the verse refers to Ali as the self of Muhammad, Shia holds that the former enjoys the same authority as the latter.[197] In contrast, most Sunni accounts by al-Tabari do not name the participants of the event, while some other Sunni historians agree with the Shia view.[194][198][192] Some accounts about mubahala add that Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn stood under Muhammad's cloak, and this five are thus known as the Ahl al-Kisa (lit. 'people of the cloak').[199][200] On the same occasion, Muhammad is also believed to have referred to them as the Ahl al-Bayt, according to Shia and some Sunni sources,[201][200] including the canonical Sahih Muslim and Sunan al-Tirmidhi.[202]\n",

            "Muslims disagree as to who belong to the Ahl al-Bayt (lit. 'people of the house') and what political privileges or responsibilities they have.[205] Shia Islam limits the Ahl al-Bayt to the Ahl al-Kisa, namely, Muhammad, Fatima, Ali, Hasan and Husayn.[206][207] There are various views in Sunni Islam, though a typical compromise is to include also Muhammad's wives in the Ahl al-Bayt.[208] The verse of purification is regarded in Shia Islam as evidence of the infallibility of the Ahl al-Bayt.[209]\n",

            "The majority of the traditions quoted by al-Tabari (d. 923) in his exegesis identify the Ahl al-Bayt in the verse of purification with the Ahl al-Kisa, namely, Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hasan, and Husayn.[209][210][200] These traditions are also cited by some other early Sunni authorities, including Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855), al-Suyuti (d. 1505), al-Hafiz al-Kabir,[211] and Ibn Kathir (d. 1373).[212] The canonical Sunni collection Sunnan al-Tirmidhi reports that Muhammad limited the Ahl al-Bayt to Ali, Fatima, and their two sons when the verse of purification was revealed to him.[213] In the event of mubahala, Muhammad is believed to have gathered Ali, Fatima, and their sons under his cloak and referred to them as the Ahl al-Bayt, according to Shia and some Sunni sources,[201][200] including the canonical Sahih Muslim and Sunan al-Tirmidhi.[202] Veccia Vaglieri writes that Muhammad recited the last passage of the verse of purification every morning when he passed by Fatima's house to remind her household of the fajr prayer.[3] This makeup of the Ahl al-Bayt is echoed by Veccia Vaglieri and Jafri,[3][214] and unanimously reported in Shia sources.[208]\n",
            "\n",
            "Possibly because the earlier injunctions in the verse of purification are addressed at Muhammad's wives,[205] some Sunni authors like Ibn Kathir include Muhammad's wives in the Ahl al-Bayt.[209] A number of Sunni hadiths, including some narrated by Ibn Abbas and Ikrima, also support the inclusion of Muhammad's wives in the Ahl al-Bayt.[215] This view is shared by Goldziher and his coauthors.[209] Alternatively, Leaman argues that only those wives of prophets who mother their successors are counted by the Quran in their ahl al-bayt.[207]\n",

            "The word kinsfolk (al-qurba) in this verse is interpreted by the Shia as the Ahl al-Bayt.[217] Ibn Ishaq (d. 767) narrates that the prophet specified al-qurba as his daughter Fatima, her husband Ali, and their two sons, Hasan and Husayn.[218] As quoted by Madelung, Hasan ibn Ali referred to the verse of mawadda in his inaugural speech as the caliph after the assassination of his father in 661, saying that he belonged to the Ahl al-Bayt \"whose love He [God] has made obligatory in His Book [Quran]...\"[219]\n",
            "\n",
            "The verse of mawadda is often cited by the Shia about the elevated status of the Ahl al-Bayt.[220] In Twelver Shia, the affection in this verse also entails obedience to the Ahl al-Bayt as the source of exoteric and esoteric guidance.[221][217] This obedience is believed to benefit the faithful first and foremost, citing the following passage of verse 34:47,[218] which contains the passage, \"Say, 'I ask not of you any reward; that shall be yours (fa-huwa la-kum).'\"[222] Some Sunni commentators agree with the Shia view, including Baydawi, al-Razi,[223] and Ibn Maghazili.[218] Most Sunni authors, however, reject the Shia view and offer various alternatives.[216] The view preferred by al-Tabari is that the verse of mawadda instructs Muslims to love the prophet because of their blood relations to him.[220][224] Alternatively, Madelung suggests that the verse of mawadda demands love towards relatives in general.[220]\n",

Thou shalt obtain good.\"[204] There also exists a version of this hadith in Sunni sources where Umm Salama is included in the Ahl al-Bayt.[208] In another Sunni version, Muhammad's servant Wathila bint al-Asqa' is counted in the Ahl al-Bayt.[241]\n",
